Hand Gesture Controller (Virtual Mouse and Input System)
This project uses a webcam and computer vision (MediaPipe) to create a virtual input system that allows users to control the mouse, clicks, scrolling, system volume, and brightness using hand gestures.

âœ¨ Features
Virtual Mouse: Move the cursor by moving your hand (V_GEST).

Mouse Clicks: Single-click, double-click, and right-click using distinct hand shapes.

Drag & Drop: Use a closed fist (FIST) to hold the left mouse button for dragging.

Scrolling: Scroll vertically and horizontally using the minor hand's pinch gesture (PINCH_MINOR).

System Controls (Windows-only for Volume): Adjust system volume and screen brightness using the major hand's pinch gesture (PINCH_MAJOR).

ðŸ’» Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed and a working webcam.
